# Multimodal-Learning-for-Calorie-Estimation
This project develops a multimodal deep learning model for estimating lunch calories using diverse data sources including CGM sequences, demographic information, microbiome profiles, and meal images. The model combines specialized neural networks (Time Series Transformer, Text Transformer, and Vision Transformer) to process different data types.
